**How It Works:**

The Heroku Applicatoin uses a database (MySql) to store burgers with a unique ID. Upon 'addiing' a burger, a unique ID is given to the burger and stored in the database. Each burger is given a name, ID, and status (devoured or not devoured). By default, the burger is not devoured. When the 'Devour' button is clicked, the burger then shifts states. HTML elements are generated using the Handlebars templates and generated server side.
